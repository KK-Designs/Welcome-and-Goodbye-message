# Welcome-and-Goodbye-message

![NPM Discord.js](https://nodei.co/npm/discord.js.png?downloads=true&stars=true)

---

A simple welcome and goodbye message for your discord bot! It also Dms the user on joining using discord.js. Currently works on discord.js v13.15.1, v14 support is coming later.


# Setup

In the discord dev portal, enable the `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`. Then in the spot where it "Put your channel ID here" fill in that spot
with what was told. Read below for more info about why. 


# Usage

Currently, this code is not for public bots. It only works for personal bots. Later it will support all guilds.

# Credits

You do not need to credit me, but if you want to, you can ðŸ™‚. You can remove the
comment I added at the bottom. Check out my other projects [here](https://github.com/KK-Designs)
